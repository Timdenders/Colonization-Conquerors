# **Colonization Conquerors: Weekly Report**
___

### Team Status Update:
#### **Goals:**
- Begin the design and implementation of mechanics related to placed objects in relation to the world, each other, and the player's numerical assets (Currency, Population, and Score counts).

#### **Progress:**
- Assigned each member a couple of game objects to focus on each object's respective game mechanics.

#### **Plans:**
- Complete isolated mechanics of individual game objects.
  - Isolated mechanics refers to mechanics specific to each object. Other mechanics, such as weather events damaging objects, will be added after the weather event's implementation.
- Design, delegate, and begin implementation of random weather events.

**NOTE:** Due to the current time frame of the semester, many of our group members have a number of exams that will negatively impact the amount of time available to progress the project. This setback should not last long.
