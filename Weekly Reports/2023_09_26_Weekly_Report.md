### Individual Contributions:

#### **Timothy Enders:**
- **Goals:**
  - Complete the sprite creation process.
  - Complete the process of ensuring that the game's user interface is fully functional and responsive for both players, free from any issues.
- **Progress:**
  - The world user interface underwent modifications.
    - Increased tile size for improved visibility into the cell interior.
    - The land and sea illustration sprite has been updated to eliminate any noticeable clipping.
    - Modified the dimensions and placements of the tilemap and scoreboard to enhance the overall design.
    - Incorporated an out-of-bounds tilemap to occupy the remaining screen space.
    - Slight adjustments to the size of each island to ensure equal spacing for fairness.
  - When a game match begins, two cursors appearâ€”one for player one and another for player two.
    - The cursors can be moved using keyboard keys in any direction, but it cannot go beyond the boundaries of the tilemap.
    - If the cursors are on the same tile space, the merged cursors will display a distinct color.
- **Plans:**
  - Start generating sprites for the game.
  - Add a keybinding to enable cursor switching, allowing it to move to a tile upon a mouse click.
  - Create keyboard shortcuts to swiftly generate constructible items.

#### **Joshua Murillo:**
- **Goals:**
  -  Finish tilemap.
    - Tilemap includes a crude layout of the two territories (land and sea) used for gameplay mechanics.
  - Add sidebar buttons.
    - Buttons are selectable (one at a time for an individual player).
    - While held, the game will place the respective object onto the last selected tile.
    - If player currency is more than object price, the object is placed onto that tile.
- **Progress:**
  - Crude tilemap was completed:
    - Map tiles can be selected by a single player (For multiple players to move around separately, see Timothy Enders' progress section).
  - Sidebar buttons in-progress:
    - Sidebar starter UI is complete.
    - Buttons are selectable and can access global player selected tile memory.
    - Buttons cannot place objects yet, but functionality for this will be completed soon.
- **Plans:**
  - Complete sidebar button functionality.
    - Add connections between player numerical info, map data, and button functionality.
