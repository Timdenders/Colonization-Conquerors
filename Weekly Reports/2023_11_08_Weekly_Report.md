# **Colonization Conquerors: Weekly Report**
___

### Team Status Update:
#### **Goals:**
- Complete isolated mechanics of individual game objects.
  - Isolated mechanics refers to mechanics specific to each object. Other mechanics, such as weather events damaging objects, will be added after the weather event's implementation.
- Design, delegate, and begin implementation of random weather events.

#### **Progress:**
- Congregated for a 9-minute meeting to discuss the project's progression and future plans.
- Implemented more game object-related mechanics.

#### **Plans:**
- Finish game object-related mechanics.
- Implement random events.
- Look into which remaining aspects of our game's development we need to complete before the Alpha's due date.
- Record a demo of our game software in use.
- Update main GitHub repository README to reflect who the game is for, how to run the game, as well as how to play the game.

#### **Joshua Murillo:**
- **Goals:**
  - Implement game mechanics related to object collision between boats and world events.
- **Progress:**
  - Created animated sprites for sea-related objects/events including fishing boats, pirates, fishing spots, collision spots, and PT boats.
    - These sprites are more detailed placeholders and will need to be updated in the future.
  - Added collision to PT boats and fishing boats of opposing player ownership. (Still tweaking specifics to this mechanic)
  - Conducted research into random pathing of pirate ships
    - Most Godot developers suggest using path-finding algorithms like A* or Dijkstra's algorithm to find a path from some starting point to some random end coordinate.
- **Plans:**
  - Fully complete the collision-related mechanics of fishing boats.
  - Implement some path-finding algorithms to have the pirate sprite move through the sea portion of the tilemap and potentially sink fishing boats.
  - Create sprites for weather events and reuse experience gained from developing the pirate pathing mechanic to the weather events.
  - Look into controller support for ease of LAN multiplayer gameplay.
