    - Add connections between player numerical info, map data, and button functionality.

- **Progress:**
    - Reworked buttons to be place in a more appropriate position.
    - Attmpted to hack at the object placement relative to the tile map positions that were last clicked.

- **Issues:**
    - Had consistant issues with the placement of objects not aligning with the intended tile positions.
        - Reasons for this may include:
            - Unfamiliarity with tilemap related functions in Godot.
            - Initial mistake of working with Object placement and tilemap interaction in separate scenes.
            - Lack of available time that was able to be allocated towards the project this past week.

- **Plans:**
    - Allocate more time to the project.
    - Add interaction between object buttons and player related variables.
    - Add conditional constraints to the object buttons.
        - Add pop-up windows that ask for confirmation when attempting to place an object and rejects the attempt if cost is unable to be paid.
