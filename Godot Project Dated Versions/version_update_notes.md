# Overview of the Godot project versions:

In the Godot Projects folder, it houses each uploaded version of our project from its first version to the most recent. The latest version of the project is based on the most recent date displayed at the beginning of the file name. Each zip file contains the Godot project, as well as sub-files for the project texture assets, scripts, interfaces, and more that make up the project's code and dependencies.
